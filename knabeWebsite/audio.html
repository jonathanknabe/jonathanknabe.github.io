        I'm glad you are interested in having me mix, master or fully produce your songs or album.

        Mixing audio is an underappreciated art form. 
        <br>Unlike the performers, a great sound engineer should be unnoticed,
        <br>And yet we are essential for the audience to experience the performance!

        <br><br>After nearly a decade of sound mixing experience in both the studio and live setting,
        <br>I have been focusing on mixing songs for artists from my home studio. 
        <br> My rate is $250 per song, which includes:
      </p>

      <ul class="mixing_list">
        <li>
          An initial first mix
        </li>
        <li>
          A second revised mix after you give it a listen
        </li>
        <li>
          One final mix with appropriate levels for mastering
        </li>
      </ul>

        So you get this awesome mix and you're ready to go, right?
        <br> You play it in your car and it sounds great! 
        <br>On your home speakers it sounds phenomenal as well.
        <br><br><br> But wait... why can't I hear it on my phone? 
        <br><br>And why does it distort all of a sudden on my laptop?
        <br><br><br> Welcome to the world of mastering!
        <br><br><br>Do I need to have my song mastered? 
        <br>Short answer: Absolutely!
        <br>What about using online automated mastering sites?
        <br>Short answer: Don't do it!
